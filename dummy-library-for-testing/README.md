## dummy-library-for-testing

The purpose of this standalone Gradle project is to publish libraries to test refreshVersions.

Initially, it's been introduced to test a refactoring related to the support of maven repositories hosted on
GCS (Google Cloud Storage). It could be used to test on other special repositories later (e.g. AWS S3).
