{badge_version} {badge_build} {badge_mit} {badge_issues} {badge_pr}

`buildSrcVersions` is a Gradle plugin that makes it easier to manage your dependencies inside your IDE.
It extracts all your dependencies and search for available dependencies updates.

[[img-libs]]
image::Libs.gif[title="_IDE integration when you put your dependencies information in the buildSrc_",alt="IDE Integration", link="{master}/doc/Libs.gif"]


Gradle has a special module called **buildSrc** where you can put Kotlin code and make it directly available to all your Gradle build files.

This is better than the traditional solution of putting your global variables in a Gradle `ext` property or in a Groovy `HashMap`,
because in that case, the IDE support is exactly what you would expect when you work with an `HashMap`.

Now, what is better than writing manually those files link:{versions_kt}[`Versions.kt`^] and link:{libs_kt}[`Libs.kt`^]?

Having a Gradle plugin write them for you maybe?

== Prerequisites

- Kotlin, JVM and Android projects.
- Gradle 4.3+ and Gradle 5.0+
- The IDE integration works for both `build.gradle` (Groovy) and `build.gradle.kts` (Kotlin) files.
- The IDE integration works in IntelliJ >= 2008.03+
- Android Studio: the IDE integration works in 3.3 and 3.5+. It was broken in 3.3 and 3.4 due https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/123032843[bug #123032843:  IDE integration with the buildSrc^]


== Installation

Edit your root `build.gradle(.kts)` file

[source,kotlin,subs=attributes]
----
buildscript {
    //...
}
plugins {
  id("de.fayard.buildSrcVersions") version "{plugin_version}"
}
// Don't put any code before the buildscripts {} and plugins {} block
----

== Extract your dependencies

The plugin adds a task to your build, also called `:buildSrcVersions`. Run it like this:

```bash
$ ./gradlew buildSrcVersions
> Task :dependencyUpdates
> Task :buildSrcVersions
        new file:   buildSrc/build.gradle.kts
        new file:   buildSrc/.gitignore
        new file:   buildSrc/settings.gradle.kts
        new file:   buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/Libs.kt
        new file:   buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/Versions.kt
```

== Replace your dependencies

Synchronize your Gradle build.

You can now start to replace your magic strings with the properties available in link:{libs_kt}[`Libs.kt`^]

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(Libs.okio)
    implementation(Libs.com_squareup_moshi_moshi)
}
```

Once you have replaced your magic strings by `Libs.xxx`, the main feature provided by this plugin is to search for dependencies updates.

== Search for dependencies updates

Upgrade dependencies tend to be tedious but it is critically important:

- Few projects have versioned documentation: `master/README.md` is their documentation.  This means you can waste time trying out snippets that do not work in the version you are using.
- When you open an issue, you will often be asked: _Can you reproduce this problem in the latest version?_

This plugin inherits from the {benmanes}[Gradle Versions plugin^]
the feature to automatically determine which dependencies have updates.

When you decide you want to update some dependencies, run again the plugin:

```bash
$ ./gradlew buildSrcVersions
> Task :dependencyUpdates
> Task :buildSrcVersions
        modified:   buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/Libs.kt
        modified:   buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/Versions.kt

```

The file link:{versions_kt}[`Versions.kt`^]  is regenerated with a comment indicating which new version is available.

```kotlin
object Versions {
    val moshi = "1.8.0"
    val com_squareup_okhttp3 = "3.11.0" // available: "3.12.0"
}
```


[[img-versions]]
image::Versions.gif[title="_buildSrcVersions search for dependencies updates and let you decide which you want to apply_",alt="IDE Integration", link="{master}/doc/Libs.gif"]

As shown in this screencast:

- To update, just delete the part `"3.11.0" // available` .
- Remove the comment if you don't want to update.
