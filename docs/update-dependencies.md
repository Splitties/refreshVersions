# Update dependencies

The core feature is gradle refreshVersions is that it will lookup automatically for available updates for all the dependencies that it manages.

This is done in three small steps:

## 1. Run the refreshVersions Gradle task

Run the `refreshVersions` gradle task on the root project:

```shell
./gradlew refreshVersions
```

**Hint:** You don't need to leave the IDE to run a Gradle task. IntelliJ has a handy action named "Execute Gradle Task":

Gradle refreshVersions is fast: it **usually takes less than 10 seconds** to execute on relatively big projects.

## 2. Apply the updates you want to

Open the `versions.properties` file.

Let say you have this initial state:

After you have run the `refreshVersions` task, you will see the available updates **as comments**:

![](img/versions.properties_step01.png)

### Why as comments?

Looking for available updates is certainly a job best done by a computer program (instead of you doing the monkey job of googling, clicking and scrolling for every single used dependency).

However, the decision of whether to upgrade or not, when, and towards which version, is best decided by the developers responsible like you.

### Edit the `versions.properties` file

If you decide to update, just replace the previous version with the update:

If you decide to **not** update for now, you can leave the comments there.

They will not affect your build, and will serve as a reminder to revisit upgrading these dependencies later. They also allow you to glance at how behind the dependencies are, which is a way to estimate the technical debt of the project regarding the dependencies upgrades.

If you want to delete these comments, it's possible too, and it's safe. Running the `refreshVersions` task will bring them back (plus any newer available update).

## 3. Perform a Gradle sync/reload

The file `versions.properties` is part of the Gradle build.

Consequently, after you have edited it, you need to ensure the IDE gets the changes.

The action to do it have a different name depending on the IDE:

**IntelliJ IDEA:**
Run the "Reload all Gradle projects" action (via {{keyboard_shortcuts.find_actions}}), or click the refresh arrows in the Gradle tool window

**Android Studio:**
Run the "Sync Project with Gradle Files" action (via {{keyboard_shortcuts.find_actions}}), or click the elephant + arrow icon in the toolbar.


At that point, you probably want to:

- ‚è≠ Migrate deprecated symbols (if any)
- üî® Ensure the codebase still builds properly
- ‚úÖ Ensure the tests still run properly
- üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Do manual testing if needed
- ‚úÖ Commit when appropriate

## Filter which versions are added to versions.properties

Maybe you don't want alpha/beta versions to show up in `versions.properties`.

This is easy to configure with a `rejectVersionIf { ... }` predicate:

=== "settings.gradle.kts"
    ```kotlin
    refreshVersions {
        rejectVersionIf {
            candidate.stabilityLevel != StabilityLevel.Stable
        }
    }
    ```
=== "settings.gradle"
    ```groovy
    refreshVersions {
        rejectVersionIf {
            candidate.stabilityLevel != StabilityLevel.Stable
        }
    }
    ```

A perhaps better approach is to display development versions only if you are already using a development version at least as stable:

=== "settings.gradle.kts"
    ```kotlin
    refreshVersions {
        rejectVersionIf {
            candidate.stabilityLevel.isLessStableThan(current.stabilityLevel)
        }
    }
    ```
=== "settings.gradle"
    ```groovy
    refreshVersions {
        rejectVersionIf {
            candidate.stabilityLevel.isLessStableThan(current.stabilityLevel)
        }
    }
    ```

`rejectVersionsIf { ...}` is pretty flexible, you can also use it to ban versions from specific version keys:

=== "settings.gradle.kts"
    ```kotlin
    refreshVersions {
        rejectVersionIf {
            val blacklist = listOf("version.retrofit", "version.okhttp3")
            versionKey in blacklist
        }
    }
    ```
=== "settings.gradle"
    ```groovy
    refreshVersions {
        rejectVersionIf {
            def blacklist =  ["version.retrofit", "version.okhttp3"]
            versionKey in blacklist
        }
    }
    ```

Or if you prefer for dependencies with specific maven coordinates:

=== "settings.gradle.kts"
    ```kotlin
    refreshVersions {
        rejectVersionIf {
            val blacklist = listOf("com.squareup.retrofit", "com.squareup.okhttp3")
            moduleId.group in blacklist
        }
    }
    ```
=== "settings.gradle"
    ```groovy
    refreshVersions {
        rejectVersionIf {
            def blacklist = ["com.squareup.retrofit", "com.squareup.okhttp3"]
            moduleId.group in blacklist
        }
    }
    ```

You can also combine all of the above to match your particular needs!
