## Adding dependencies

### Built-in dependencies constants

refreshVersions provides read-to-use organized constants for select
popular dependencies of the following ecosystems:

- Kotlin Multiplatform
- Kotlin/JVM
- Android

*That doesn’t prevent you from using refreshVersions in a Gradle project that is not using Kotlin or is not an Android project.*

You can use them in any `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` file.

Here's an example of how it looks like in the IDE:

*No imports needed.*

*Autocomplete in IDE for easy discoverability.*

You can see [all the dependency objects in this directory](https://github.com/jmfayard/refreshVersions/tree/master/plugins/dependencies/src/main/kotlin/dependencies).

### Wait, what version are those dependencies using?

All these dependency constants specify their version as the version
placeholder (`_`), so refreshVersions can replace it seamlessly with the
value defined in the `versions.properties` file.

After adding a dependency that doesn't have its version specified in the
`versions.properties` file yet, refreshVersions will edit it and put the
most stable recent version in it on the next Gradle sync (or any other
Gradle run).

It will also put any less stable versions as comments, allowing you to
quickly upgrade if needed.

### Adding Gradle plugins

This section doesn't apply to plugins that are configured in a
`buildscript` block (since these have their versions configured like
regular dependencies), but only to those that are configured solely with
a plugin id.

To add such a plugin, do as usual, but do not specify the version in the
`build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` file. Instead, set it up like so in
the `versions.properties` file:

```properties
# versions.properties

plugin.com.apollographql.apollo=2.4.1

plugin.com.squareup.sqldelight=1.4.3
```

Then you can omit the plugin version in all `build.gradle(.kts)` of your project

=== "Kotlin"
    ```kotlin
    // SOME_MODULE/build.gradle.kts
    plugins {
        id("com.squareup.sqldelight")
        id("com.apollographql.apollo")
    }
    ```
=== "Groovy"
    ```kotlin
    // SOME_MODULE/build.gradle
    plugins {
        id 'com.squareup.sqldelight'
        id 'com.apollographql.apollo'
    }
    ```


As you see, the convention is pretty simple. The key `plugin.some.plugin.id` sets the version of the plugin `id("some.plugin.id")´.

## Gradle buildSrcVersions

Yet another approach to managing dependencies is to use the **Gradle buildSrc** module, and to auto-magically generate a file `Libs.kt` that contains all the dependencies applied to your build:

```kotlin
/**
 * Generated by `$ ./gradlew buildSrcVersions`
 */
object Libs {
    const val annotation: String = "androidx.annotation:annotation:_"

    const val guava: String = "com.google.guava:guava:_"

    const val guice: String = "com.google.inject:guice:_"

}
```

Because this file used the placeholder version `_`, it is compatible with gradle refreshVersions!

**This feature is not done yet, if you think we should prioritze it, please follow the issue https://github.com/jmfayard/refreshVersions/issues/235**


## Package Search from JetBrains

JetBrains proposes the plugin [**Package Search**](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12507-package-search).

Package Search provides a nice UX to add a dependency

Can you use it with refreshVersions?

Sure, just use the version place holder `_`.

## The libraries.gradle pattern

An older approach to centralize dependencies is to have a `libraries.gradle` file

```groovy
// libraries.gradle
ext.libraries = [ // Groovy map literal
    spring_core: "org.springframework:spring-core:3.1",
    junit: "junit:junit:4.10"
]

// MODULE/libraries.gradle
apply(from = "../libraries.gradle")

dependencies {
    compile libraries.spring_core
    testCompile libraries.junit
}
```

Does that work with refreshVersions too? Yes, just use the version place holder `_`


```diff
ext.libraries = [ // Groovy map literal
-    spring_core: "org.springframework:spring-core:3.1",
+    spring_core: "org.springframework:spring-core:_",
-    junit: "junit:junit:4.10"
+    junit: "junit:junit:_"
]
```
