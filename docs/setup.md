# Setup

This guide will help you set up refreshVersions in a Gradle project.

## Update Gradle (if needed)

Gradle 6.8+ is required because this plugin relies on Kotlin 1.4.

Updating Gradle is anyway usually a good idea. You get fewer bugs, more
features, and faster builds.

!!! note "See available Gradle updates"

    Gradle maintains a page that references all the releases at [gradle.org/releases](https://gradle.org/releases/).

    It can be helpful if you find out you need/want to upgrade your project to a specific version.

Run this command to update:

```shell
./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version {{version.gradle}}
```

!!! info "If the command fails"

    If that command fails, locate the `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file,
    and edit the distribution url to the Gradle version you want to update to.

!!! warning "Don't rely on the IDE for troubleshooting"

    If you are in the process of troubleshooting a failing build, we recommend that you
    **do it in the terminal** rather than trying to perform a Gradle sync/import/reload in
    the IDE, because it will unfortunately not show the root causes of the failures.

You should also try to update the Gradle plugins present in your build to the latest version. For example on an Android project, do update the version of the Gradle Android Plugin.

The Gradle documentation has detailed migration guides if you are stuck:

- From Gradle 7+: https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/upgrading_version_7.html
- From Gradle 6+: https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/upgrading_version_6.html
- From Gradle 5.x: https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/upgrading_version_5.html
- From Gradle 4.x: https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/upgrading_version_4.html



## Add the plugin

Here is how to configure gradle refreshVersions:

=== "settings.gradle.kts"
    ```kotlin
    plugins {
        // See https://jmfayard.github.io/refreshVersions
        id("de.fayard.refreshVersions") version "{{version.refreshVersions}}"
    }
    ```
=== "settings.gradle"
    ```groovy
    plugins {
        // See https://jmfayard.github.io/refreshVersions
        id 'de.fayard.refreshVersions' version '{{version.refreshVersions}}'
    }
    ```


### If you have a buildSrc module

If you use the **buildSrc** module and have dependencies declared in the `buildSrc/build.gradle[.kts]` file, you probably want to use refreshVersions there as well. The setup is the same:

=== "buildSrc/settings.gradle.kts"
    ```kotlin
    pluginManagement {
        repositories {
            gradlePluginPortal()
        }
        plugins {
            id("de.fayard.refreshVersions") version "{{version.refreshVersions}}"
        }
    }

    plugins {
        id("de.fayard.refreshVersions")
    }
    ```
=== "buildSrc/settings.gradle"
    ```groovy
    pluginManagement {
        repositories {
            gradlePluginPortal()
        }
        plugins {
            id 'de.fayard.refreshVersions' version '{{version.refreshVersions}}'
        }
    }

    plugins {
        id 'de.fayard.refreshVersions'
    }
    ```

### If you use Groovy DSL, i.e. build.gradle files (not kts)

**Auto-completion for dependency notations won't work out of the box.**

A workaround is to configure the plugin in the `buildSrc` module (create the directory if it doesn't exist yet):

=== "buildSrc/settings.gradle"
    ```groovy
    pluginManagement {
        repositories {
            gradlePluginPortal()
        }
        plugins {
            id 'de.fayard.refreshVersions' version '{{version.refreshVersions}}'
        }
    }

    plugins {
        id 'de.fayard.refreshVersions'
    }
    ```


### If you have a composite/included build

Sharing used versions with included builds is not supported at the moment.

If you need/want this feature, please vote with a üëç on [this issue]({{link.issues}}/205), subscribe to it, and tell us about your use case, to help us prioritize.

### If you want to use a snapshot version

=== "settings.gradle.kts"
    ```kotlin
    pluginManagement {
        repositories {
            gradlePluginPortal()
            maven("https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots")
        }
    }
    plugins {
        // See https://jmfayard.github.io/refreshVersions
        id("de.fayard.refreshVersions") version "{{version.snapshot}}"
    }
    ```
=== "settings.gradle"
    ```groovy
    pluginManagement {
        repositories {
            gradlePluginPortal()
            maven { url 'https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots' }
        }
    }
    plugins {
        // See https://jmfayard.github.io/refreshVersions
        id 'de.fayard.refreshVersions' version '{{version.snapshot}}'
    }
    ```


## Configure the plugin

There is no required configuration!

There are some options which can be configured in the `refreshVersions { }` block.

If you are curious about what are the available options, you can use auto-complete (you can also type `this.` before to filter the results).

## Earlier versions

### If you are upgrading from the buildSrcVersions plugin

Before refreshVersions, [there was the plugin buildSrcVersions](https://dev.to/jmfayard/better-dependency-management-in-android-studio-3-5-with-gradle-buildsrcversions-34e9).

If your project is using it, remove all its configuration from the top `build.gradle[.kts]` file to avoid any clashes between the two plugins:

=== "build.gradle.kts"
```diff
-plugins {
-    id("de.fayard.buildSrcVersions") version "0.3.2"
-}

-buildSrcVersions {
-    someOption = "somevalue"
-}
```

Then, enable `buildSrcLibs` as such:

=== "settings.gradle.kts"
    ```kotlin
    plugins {
        // See https://jmfayard.github.io/refreshVersions
        id("de.fayard.refreshVersions") version "{{version.refreshVersions}}"
    }

    refreshVersions {
        enableBuildSrcLibs() // <-- Add this
    }
    ```
=== "settings.gradle"
    ```groovy
    plugins {
        // See https://jmfayard.github.io/refreshVersions
        id 'de.fayard.refreshVersions' version '{{version.refreshVersions}}'
    }

    refreshVersions {
        enableBuildSrcLibs() // <-- Add this
    }
    ```
