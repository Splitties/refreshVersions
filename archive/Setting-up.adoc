= Setting up

This guide will help you setting up refreshVersions in a Gradle project.

Adding the plugin is very quick and straightforward.

Setting up the dependencies so refreshVersions can show their
updates is a little longer process, but fear not,
a semi-automated tool is built-in to help you do this without
breaking your build.

_Note: Only Gradle 6+ is supported at the moment, because it allows for simpler setup._

_Updating Gradle is usually a good idea. You get fewer bugs,
more features and more build speed, and it's as simple as this:_

`$ ./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version {gradle_version}`

== Step 1: Adding the plugin

=== Bootstrap in root project

If you're using *Gradle Kotlin DSL*, add the following snippet in your project's root `settings.gradle.kts` file:

[source,kts,subs=attributes]
----
// settings.gradle.kts
import de.fayard.refreshVersions.bootstrapRefreshVersions

// Here you might have some pluginManagement block:
pluginManagement {
    //...
}

buildscript {
    repositories { gradlePluginPortal() }
    dependencies.classpath("de.fayard.refreshVersions:refreshVersions:{last_version}")
}

bootstrapRefreshVersions()
----

If you're using *Gradle Groovy DSL*, use the same snippet as above for your root project's `settings.gradle` file, then:

1. Replace the import with `import de.fayard.refreshVersions.RefreshVersionsSetup`
2. Replace the `bootstrapRefreshVersions()` call with `RefreshVersionsSetup.bootstrap(settings)`


=== Bootstrap for buildSrc (if you use it)

I you use {buildSrc_doc}[`buildSrc`], you probably want to use refreshVersions there as well.
Here's how to do so:

If you're using *Gradle Kotlin DSL*, add the following snippet in your the `settings.gradle.kts` file of your `buildSrc`:

[source,kts,subs=attributes]
----
// settings.gradle.kts
import de.fayard.refreshVersions.bootstrapRefreshVersionsForBuildSrc

// Here you might have some pluginManagement block:
pluginManagement {
    //...
}

buildscript {
    repositories { gradlePluginPortal() }
    dependencies.classpath("de.fayard.refreshVersions:refreshVersions:{last_version}")
}

bootstrapRefreshVersionsForBuildSrc()
----

If you're using *Gradle Groovy DSL*, use the same snippet as above for your root project's `settings.gradle` file, then:

1. Replace the import with `import de.fayard.refreshVersions.RefreshVersionsSetup`
2. Replace the `bootstrapRefreshVersionsForBuildSrc()` call with `RefreshVersionsSetup.bootstrapForBuildSrc(settings)`


=== Bootstrap for composite/included builds (if you use them)

Included builds are not supported yet. If you need/want this feature, please vote with a üëç
on {included_builds_support}[this issue] to help us prioritize.

== Step 2: Migrating the dependencies versions declaration place

Run the following command on the root project:

`./gradlew migrateToRefreshVersionsDependenciesConstants --console=plain`

This Gradle task is interactive.
It will walk you through every module of your Gradle project,
assisting you in replacing every hardcoded dependency version by the
version placeholder (`_`), and an entry in the `versions.properties` file,
for every configuration.

_Note that while this Gradle task cannot break your build, it is experimental.
We are aware its UX can be improved, and we have plans to work on it before the 1.0 release._

== Using a development version

In case you want to try new features or get a fix for a bug that affects a project you work on,
before they make it into a release, you can use a development version.

To do so, in your `settings.gradle[.kts]` file(s), ensure the `buildscript` has this maven repository:
`https://dl.bintray.com/jmfayard/maven`, and set a valid dev version, as such:

[source,kts,subs=attributes]
----
buildscript {
    repositories { maven(url = "https://dl.bintray.com/jmfayard/maven") } // <- here
    dependencies.classpath("de.fayard.refreshVersions:refreshVersions:{last_dev_version}")
}
----

You can find the published development versions by searching in the recent commits on the develop
branch, they start with "Dev version".
