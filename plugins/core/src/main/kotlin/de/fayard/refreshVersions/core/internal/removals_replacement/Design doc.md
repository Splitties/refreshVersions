# Dependency notations replacements and removals

Must be done at init time (in `settingsEvaluated { ‚Ä¶ }`) because it shall happen before build files are compiled and evaluated.

## How to detect removal?

Tests checking for no removal would instead populate the new file for removed dependency notations.

### Where should these be put it given versioning constraints?

Do we need to parse our own version?

Or should keep something analogue to Android app's `versionCode`?
Can this be fully be automated?
If the VersionsPropertiesModel doesn't keep that value, can we use an internal map for the matching versions, when there's a match, in a way that would also work for snapshots, or disregard unexpected suffixes?

## How to detect

## Implementation path

### Any migration to make?

In `bootstrapRefreshVersionsCore`, figure out efficiently if refreshVersions has just been updated.

### Doing the migration

#### ‚úÖüßê Required data:

An ordered list (oldest to newest) with the following data for all removals since last upgrade:
- dependency notation
- corresponding dependency notation
- reason of removal
  - Usually deprecation, with direct replacement or not.
  - coordinates of replacement, if any
  - info url, if any
  - actionable info for a TODO comment?

#### ‚úÖ Removed dependency notations storage/file-format

```markdown
## Revision 1

~~AndroidX.wear.watchFace.client~~
//
moved:[androidx.wear.watchface..watchface-client]
id:[androidx.wear..wear-watchface-client]

## Revision 2
~~SomeGroup.something~~
id:[com.somegroup..somegroup-something]
```

#### Tests update

‚úÖ Removed dependency notations shall be removed from the `dependencies-mapping-validated.txt` file to avoid clash when the
maven coordinates stay the same, but the dependency notation moves.

‚úÖ The list of removed dependency notations should be prefilled in the WIP section.

‚úÖ We need a test that fails when there's a WIP section.

‚úÖ We need to force tests to run (and pass) before any publishing task happens.

‚úÖ Fail the build if there's a non snapshot release without an entry in the release to revision mapping

#### Updating the removals revisions

‚úÖ Fill `version-to-removals-revision-mapping.txt` for releases.
‚úÖ Write (SNAPSHOT) or remove (release) a generated resource for the removals revision number.
‚úÖ Edit (all) version parsing AND writing for `versions.properties` to handle removals revision for snapshots.

#### Migration operation:

Keep in mind it shall:
- ‚úÖ Honor the `withVersion(‚Ä¶)`, `withoutVersion()` and others when rewriting.
- üôè Not be able to break the build.
- ‚è≥ Let the user know about the rewrite via a warning log.

1. ‚úÖ Find where the updating code should be.
2. ‚úÖ Find what the `bootstrapRefreshVersionsCore` function will need to support replacement of removed dependency notations.
3. ‚úÖ Get the last removals revision from `versions.properties` if it was a snapshot, or from the mapping if it was a mapped release, or default to 0.
4. ‚úÖ Find all `build.gradle[.kts]` files efficiently. Don't rely on include because it might be dynamic, and we don't want to track migration on a per-module basis as it'd increase the complexity on user-side.
5. ‚úÖ Update the version in `versions.properties`, including the revision if current version is a snapshot.

#### ‚úÖ Example results

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // SomeGroup.something has been replaced,
    // following the deprecation of the com.somegroup:somegroup-something artifact
    //FIXME: Replace with the new dependency and remove these comments.
    // d
    api("com.somegroup:somegroup-something:_")
//moved:SomeGroup.somethingElse)
}
```
