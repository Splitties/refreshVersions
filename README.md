## Usage

Make sure the project is correctly set up (see just above).

**Migrate project:**

The `refreshVersionsMigrate` task can help you migrate your project in a few minutes, or less.

In version 0.50.0, support for Gradle's Versions Catalogs was added ([see discussion thread here](https://github.com/Splitties/refreshVersions/discussions/592)), so a `--mode` option is now required.

Run it without it to see the complete list and the full description of each mode:

```shell
./gradlew refreshVersionsMigrate
```

If you want to use only `versions.properties` and the [built-in dependencies notations](https://splitties.github.io/refreshVersions/dependency-notations/), run:

`./gradlew refreshVersionsMigrate --mode=VersionsPropertiesOnly`

To also use a versions catalog for non-built-in dependency notations, run:

`./gradlew refreshVersionsMigrate --mode=VersionCatalogAndVersionProperties`

</details>

**Find available updates in `versions.properties` and the default versions catalog, if any:**

`./gradlew refreshVersions`

**Cleanup versions availability comments:**

`./gradlew refreshVersionsCleanup`
